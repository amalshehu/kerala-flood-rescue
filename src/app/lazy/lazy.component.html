<h1>Lazy loading</h1>
<p><strong>Lazy loading</strong> is a design pattern used to defer initialization time of an web application.</p>
<p>Thanks to Angular @NgModule we are able to load pieces of our apps on demand. That helps us decrease the startup time, because application doesn't need to load everything at once. Lazily loaded modules will only be downloaded when user navigates to their routes.</p>
